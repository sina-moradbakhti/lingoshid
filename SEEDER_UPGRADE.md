# 🎉 Seeder Upgrade Complete!

## ✨ What's New

Your seeder has been **completely upgraded** with the following features:

### 1. ✅ Run Multiple Times Without Duplicates!

The seeder now generates **unique users** every time using timestamp-based batch IDs:

- **Before:** Could only run once (would create duplicates)
- **After:** Run as many times as you want! Each batch gets unique emails

**Example:**
- First run: `student.234567.1@demo.com`
- Second run: `student.239801.1@demo.com`
- Third run: `student.245392.1@demo.com`

### 2. 🚀 New Deploy Script Option

Added **Option 6** to `deploy.sh`:

```bash
./deploy.sh
# Select 6: Seed demo data (100 students)
```

**Features:**
- Interactive confirmation
- Shows batch ID for reference
- Displays login credentials
- Safe to run multiple times

### 3. 🎯 Smart Teacher/Admin Handling

- Teachers and admin are **created once**
- Subsequent runs skip them (no duplicates)
- Only new students/parents are created each time

### 4. 📊 Increased to 100 Students

Changed from 50 to **100 students per batch** (you already did this!)

## 🚀 How to Use on Your Server

### First Time Setup:

```bash
cd ~/lingoshid
./deploy.sh

# Select 1: Fresh deployment
# This will automatically seed the first batch
```

### Add More Demo Data:

```bash
cd ~/lingoshid
./deploy.sh

# Select 6: Seed demo data (100 students)
# Run this as many times as you want!
```

Each run will add **100 new students** to your database!

## 🔑 Login Credentials

### Teachers (Always the same)
- `teacher@demo.com` / `demo123`
- `teacher2@demo.com` / `demo123`
- `teacher3@demo.com` / `demo123`

### Students (Look for batch ID in logs)
- Format: `student.XXXXXX.1@demo.com` / `demo123`
- XXXXXX = 6-digit batch ID shown in logs
- Example: `student.234567.1@demo.com`

### Parents (Same batch ID as students)
- Format: `parent.XXXXXX.1@demo.com` / `demo123`
- Example: `parent.234567.1@demo.com`

### Admin (Always the same)
- `admin@demo.com` / `demo123`
