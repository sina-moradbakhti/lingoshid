1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Digital game-based learning (DGBL) has emerged as a transformative pedagogical
approach in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, particularly for developing
speaking skills among young learners. Gamification, defined as the integration of game
design elements such as points, badges, leaderboards, and challenges into non-game
contexts, has shown significant potential in enhancing language learning outcomes (Liu
et al., 2025; Tsang & Davis, 2024). In the Iranian EFL context, where traditional teaching
methods often dominate primary education, the implementation of gamified learning
platforms represents a promising avenue for addressing persistent challenges in speaking
skill development.
Speaking proficiency remains one of the most challenging aspects of EFL learning for
Iranian primary school students, who often experience high levels of foreign language
anxiety and limited opportunities for authentic oral communication practice (Ahmed,
2022; Yang et al., 2023). Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that gamification
can effectively reduce anxiety among EFL learners while promoting active learning
processes. The integration of game elements into language learning environments creates
a more engaging and less threatening atmosphere for oral practice, potentially addressing
the psychological barriers that impede speaking development in young learners.
The theoretical foundation for gamified language learning draws from multiple
educational paradigms, including constructivist learning theory, motivation theory, and
flow theory. Research by Reinders and Wattana (2015) demonstrated that DGBL could
alleviate anxiety, making students more receptive to using the target language. This
psychological benefit is particularly crucial for speaking skill development, as oral
communication anxiety represents a significant obstacle to fluency development in EFL
contexts.
Contemporary research in gamified EFL instruction has revealed promising outcomes
across various language skills and learner populations. Studies have found that
gamification has been widely utilized in more than ten non-English-speaking countries
and various English language skills, with benefits including improving engagement,
motivation, and learning outcomes. However, despite the growing body of research on
gamification in language learning, there remains a significant gap in understanding its
specific impact on speaking skill development among Iranian primary school students,
who face unique cultural and educational challenges in EFL learning contexts.
The integration of technology in Iranian primary education settings presents both
opportunities and challenges. While digital literacy among young learners continues to
improve, the effective implementation of gamified learning platforms requires careful
consideration of pedagogical design, cultural appropriateness, and technical
infrastructure. Understanding how gamification elements can be optimally configured to
support speaking skill development in this specific context is essential for maximizing
educational benefits while ensuring sustainable implementation.
1.2 Statement of the Problem
Speaking skill development in Iranian primary EFL education faces multiple
interconnected challenges that traditional teaching methods have struggled to address
effectively. Students at the primary level often experience significant foreign language
anxiety, limited authentic communication opportunities, and reduced motivation due to
teacher-centered instructional approaches (Ahmed, 2022; Liu et al., 2025). These
challenges are particularly pronounced in the Iranian educational context, where cultural
factors, large class sizes, and examination-focused curricula create additional barriers to
effective oral communication practice.
Research has consistently identified foreign language anxiety as a primary impediment to
speaking proficiency development among EFL learners. Digital game-based learning can
promote an active learning process and reduce anxiety among EFL learners, as anxiety
refers to "the subjective feeling of tensions, apprehensions, nervousness, and worries
related to an excitement of the autonomic nervous system". This anxiety is often
exacerbated in traditional classroom environments where students fear making mistakes
in front of peers and teachers, leading to reluctance to engage in oral communication
activities.
The problem is further complicated by the limited availability of engaging,
age-appropriate digital learning resources specifically designed for Iranian primary
school students. While gamification has shown promise in various educational contexts,
systematic reviews reveal that the effectiveness of gamified tools in foreign language
learning was mixed, with some bringing positive changes, others negative changes, and
some showing no differences. This inconsistency suggests that the success of gamified
learning interventions depends heavily on factors such as pedagogical design, target
population characteristics, and implementation strategies.
Additionally, current research on gamified EFL learning has predominantly focused on
older learners or general language skills, leaving a significant gap in understanding how
gamification specifically impacts speaking skill development among primary school
students. The unique developmental, cognitive, and motivational characteristics of young
learners require tailored approaches that may differ substantially from those effective
with adolescent or adult populations.
The absence of empirically validated gamified learning platforms designed specifically
for Iranian primary EFL contexts represents a critical gap in the literature. Without
evidence-based understanding of how gamification elements can be optimally configured
to support speaking development in this population, educators and policymakers lack the
necessary guidance for implementing effective technology-enhanced language learning
programs.
Therefore, this study addresses the urgent need to investigate the impact of a carefully
designed gamified EFL learning platform on Iranian primary school students' speaking
development, providing empirical evidence to inform pedagogical practices and
educational technology implementation in this underexplored context.
1.3 Purpose of the Study
The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a gamified EFL learning
platform on Iranian primary school students' speaking development. The study aims to
examine whether the integration of game design elements including points, badges,
leaderboards, and progress tracking can significantly enhance speaking skills including
fluency, pronunciation, and confidence among young EFL learners in the Iranian
educational context.
Specifically, the study seeks to determine the effectiveness of gamified learning
interventions in addressing the multifaceted challenges that impede speaking skill
development in traditional Iranian primary EFL classrooms. By implementing a carefully
designed gamified platform and comparing its outcomes with conventional teaching
methods, the research endeavors to provide empirical evidence regarding the potential of
game-based approaches to transform speaking instruction for young learners.
Drawing on contemporary research emphasizing the motivational and anxiety-reducing
benefits of gamification in language learning (Liu et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2023), this
study builds upon the growing body of literature on digital game-based learning while
addressing the specific needs and characteristics of Iranian primary school students. The
findings will contribute to pedagogical knowledge by demonstrating how educators can
leverage gamification strategies to create more engaging, effective, and psychologically
supportive environments for speaking skill development.
The study also aims to provide practical insights for curriculum developers, educational
technology designers, and policymakers interested in implementing innovative
approaches to EFL instruction in Iranian primary education settings, ultimately
supporting more effective and enjoyable language learning experiences for young
learners.
1.4 Significance of the Study
This study represents a significant contribution to the field of EFL education by
addressing critical gaps in our understanding of gamified learning interventions for
speaking skill development among primary school students in the Iranian context. The
significance of this research extends across theoretical, pedagogical, and practical
dimensions, offering valuable insights for multiple stakeholders in language education.
From a theoretical perspective, this study advances our understanding of how game
design principles can be effectively integrated into speaking instruction for young EFL
learners. Recent research has shown significant attention to the integration of digital
technologies into language learning, particularly in EFL education contexts, yet limited
empirical evidence exists regarding the specific mechanisms through which gamification
enhances oral communication skills in primary-aged learners. The findings may
contribute to theories of motivation, engagement, and anxiety reduction in language
learning contexts.
Pedagogically, the study addresses the urgent need for evidence-based approaches to
speaking instruction that can effectively engage young learners while reducing the
psychological barriers that impede oral communication practice. Traditional teaching
methods in Iranian primary EFL contexts often fail to provide sufficient opportunities for
meaningful speaking practice, and this research offers insights into how gamified
platforms can supplement and enhance conventional instruction.
The practical significance of this study is particularly relevant for Iranian educational
contexts, where the integration of technology in language learning is increasingly
recognized as essential for improving educational outcomes. The findings will provide
actionable recommendations for teachers, curriculum designers, and educational
technology developers seeking to implement effective gamified learning solutions in
primary EFL settings.
Furthermore, the study may inform educational policy discussions regarding the
integration of digital learning technologies in Iranian primary education. As educational
systems worldwide increasingly recognize the importance of 21st-century digital skills
and engaging pedagogical approaches, this research provides empirical evidence to
support decision-making regarding technology adoption and teacher training initiatives.
Finally, the study's focus on speaking skill development addresses a critical need in
Iranian EFL education, where oral communication proficiency remains a significant
challenge for learners at all levels. By demonstrating effective approaches to speaking
instruction for primary students, the research may contribute to long-term improvements
in English language proficiency across the Iranian educational system.

1.7 Definitions of Key Terms
1.7.1 Gamification
Gamification refers to the integration of game design elements and principles into
non-game contexts to enhance engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes. In
educational settings, gamification typically includes elements such as points, badges,
leaderboards, challenges, progress bars, and reward systems (Liu et al., 2025; Tsang &
Davis, 2024). In this study, gamification will be operationalized through a digital
platform incorporating these elements specifically designed for EFL speaking practice.
1.7.2 Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL)
Digital game-based learning is a pedagogical approach that utilizes digital games or
game-like elements to facilitate learning and skill development. DGBL can promote an
active learning process and reduce anxiety among EFL learners by creating engaging,
interactive learning environments that support knowledge acquisition and skill practice
through gameplay mechanics.
1.7.3 Speaking Development
Speaking development refers to the progressive improvement in oral communication
skills in a second or foreign language, encompassing multiple dimensions including
fluency (the ability to speak smoothly and naturally), pronunciation accuracy (correct
articulation of sounds and stress patterns), and speaking confidence (the willingness and
self-assurance to engage in oral communication). This study measures these three
components as indicators of overall speaking skill advancement.
1.7.4 EFL (English as a Foreign Language)
EFL refers to the teaching and learning of English in non-English speaking countries
where English is not the primary language of communication in society. In the Iranian
context, EFL learning occurs primarily in formal educational settings with limited
exposure to authentic English communication outside the classroom environment.
1.7.5 Primary School Students
Primary school students refer to learners typically aged 6-12 years who are enrolled in
elementary education programs. In the Iranian educational system, primary education
encompasses grades 1-6, and this study focuses on students in upper primary grades
(grades 4-6) who have foundational English language exposure and are developmentally
ready for structured speaking practice.
1.7.6 Foreign Language Anxiety
Foreign language anxiety is a psychological construct referring to the feelings of tension,
apprehension, nervousness, and worry specifically associated with foreign language
learning contexts. This type of anxiety is particularly relevant to speaking activities and
can significantly impede oral communication development in EFL learners (Ahmed,
2022).
1.7.7 Language Learning Platform
A language learning platform is a digital environment or application designed specifically
to facilitate second or foreign language acquisition through structured learning activities,
interactive exercises, and progress tracking features. In this study, the platform
incorporates gamification elements specifically targeting speaking skill development.
1.8 Limitations and Delimitations
This study, like all empirical research, operates within certain limitations and
delimitations that define its scope and potential generalizability.
a. Limitations
Several limitations must be acknowledged in this study. First, the participants will be
selected through convenience sampling from accessible primary schools, which may limit
the generalizability of findings to the broader population of Iranian primary EFL learners.
Second, the study duration of six weeks, while adequate for measuring short-term
impacts, may not capture long-term retention effects of gamified learning interventions.
Third, the reliance on teacher assessments and self-report measures for some variables
may introduce subjective bias in the evaluation of speaking skills. Fourth, individual
differences in students' prior technology experience and digital literacy may influence
their engagement with the gamified platform, potentially confounding the results. Finally,
the study's focus on a single gamified platform design means that findings may not
generalize to other types of game-based learning interventions.
b. Delimitations
The study is deliberately delimited in several ways to maintain focus and ensure
methodological rigor. Participants are limited to Iranian primary school students in grades
4-6 (ages 9-12) to ensure developmental appropriateness and comparability across the
sample. The research focuses specifically on speaking skill development rather than other
language skills to allow for in-depth investigation of oral communication outcomes. The
intervention period is delimited to six weeks to provide sufficient time for measurable
skill development while maintaining practical feasibility for implementation in school
settings. The study employs a quantitative quasi-experimental design and does not
include extensive qualitative data collection such as interviews or detailed observational
data, allowing for focused statistical analysis of learning outcomes. Finally, the research
is geographically delimited to urban and suburban primary schools in Tehran province to
control for socioeconomic and educational infrastructure variables that might influence
technology implementation.
2. Review of Literature
2.1 Introduction
The integration of digital technologies in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education
has undergone significant evolution in recent years, with gamification emerging as one of
the most promising pedagogical innovations for enhancing learner engagement and skill
development. The theoretical and empirical foundations for gamified language learning
draw from multiple disciplines, including educational psychology, cognitive science,
game studies, and second language acquisition research (Liu et al., 2025; Yang et al.,
2023).
In foreign language education, educators struggle with declining student engagement as
traditional EFL teaching, relying on passive lectures and conventional methods, often
fails to maintain learner motivation and interest. This challenge is particularly acute in
contexts where students have limited exposure to authentic English communication, such
as in Iranian primary schools, where traditional grammar-translation methods and
teacher-centered approaches have long dominated instruction.
The emergence of gamification as a pedagogical strategy represents a response to these
challenges, offering potential solutions through the integration of intrinsically motivating
game elements into educational contexts. Research by Tsang and Davis (2024) found that
entertainment-oriented activities such as playing games and listening to songs were the
most commonly enjoyed events in the EFL classroom, while activities that are simple,
easy, free, relaxed, and different from the usual were also deemed enjoyable by young
learners.
The theoretical framework supporting gamified language learning is multifaceted,
incorporating motivational theories such as Self-Determination Theory, which
emphasizes the importance of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in promoting
intrinsic motivation. Game-based learning environments can address these psychological
needs by providing learners with choices (autonomy), appropriately challenging tasks
with clear feedback (competence), and opportunities for social interaction and
collaboration (relatedness).
Furthermore, the concept of "flow" theory, developed by Csikszentmihalyi, provides
additional theoretical support for gamified learning approaches. Flow states,
characterized by deep engagement and optimal learning conditions, can be facilitated
through well-designed game mechanics that balance challenge and skill levels while
providing immediate feedback and clear goals.
Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have attempted to synthesize the growing
body of empirical evidence regarding gamification's effectiveness in language learning
contexts. Studies have found that gamification has been widely utilized in more than ten
non-English-speaking countries and various English language skills, with benefits
including improving engagement, motivation, and reducing anxiety in English listening
and speaking. However, the research also reveals considerable variation in outcomes,
suggesting that the effectiveness of gamified interventions depends heavily on factors
such as implementation quality, learner characteristics, and pedagogical design principles.
2.2 Gamification in Language Learning
Gamification in language learning represents the strategic application of game design
elements and principles to educational contexts with the goal of enhancing learner
motivation, engagement, and achievement. The conceptual framework of gamification
extends beyond simple point-scoring systems to encompass a comprehensive approach
that leverages the psychological and motivational mechanisms that make games
inherently engaging.
Empirical evidence indicates that gamification enhances vocabulary retention,
grammatical accuracy, and communicative fluency by providing interactive,
reward-based learning experiences. Popular gamified platforms, including Duolingo,
Kahoot!, and Classcraft, have been analyzed to demonstrate best practices in educational
game design. These platforms illustrate how different gamification elements can be
combined to create cohesive learning experiences that maintain learner interest while
supporting skill development.
The core elements of effective educational gamification typically include several key
components. Progress visualization through experience points, level systems, and
progress bars provides learners with clear feedback about their advancement and creates a
sense of achievement. Badge systems and achievement unlocking create milestone
rewards that recognize specific accomplishments and encourage continued engagement.
Leaderboards and social comparison features can motivate learners through friendly
competition, though these must be carefully implemented to avoid negative effects on
less confident learners.
Challenge and quest systems provide structure and purpose to learning activities,
transforming routine practice exercises into goal-oriented missions. Immediate feedback
mechanisms, a hallmark of effective games, ensure learners receive instant information
about their performance, facilitating rapid error correction and skill refinement. Finally,
narrative elements and thematic frameworks can provide meaningful context for learning
activities, making abstract linguistic concepts more concrete and memorable.
2.2.1 Theoretical Foundations of Gamification
The theoretical underpinnings of gamification in education draw from several established
psychological and educational theories. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) provides
perhaps the most relevant framework, emphasizing three fundamental psychological
needs: autonomy (the need to feel volitional and self-directed), competence (the need to
feel effective and capable), and relatedness (the need to feel connected to others and
experience a sense of belonging).
Well-designed gamified learning environments can support these needs through carefully
implemented features. Autonomy can be supported through choice in learning paths,
customizable avatars or profiles, and optional challenge levels. Competence needs are
addressed through appropriately scaled challenges, clear progress indicators, and
achievement systems that recognize incremental improvements. Relatedness can be
fostered through collaborative features, peer interaction opportunities, and social
recognition systems.
Cognitive Load Theory also provides important insights for gamification design,
suggesting that learning is optimized when cognitive resources are efficiently allocated
between essential learning processes and extraneous elements. Effective educational
games must carefully balance motivational elements with cognitive demands to avoid
overwhelming learners or distracting from core learning objectives.
Flow Theory contributes additional design principles, emphasizing the importance of
maintaining optimal challenge levels that match learner abilities while providing clear
goals and immediate feedback. The flow state, characterized by deep engagement and
intrinsic motivation, represents the ideal learning condition that well-designed gamified
systems aim to achieve.
2.2.2 Empirical Evidence on Gamification Effectiveness
Recent empirical research on gamification in language learning has yielded increasingly
sophisticated insights into the conditions under which game-based approaches are most
effective. Research demonstrates that DGBL could alleviate anxiety, making students
more receptive to using the target language, with this reduction in anxiety likely
contributing to increased enjoyment and motivation. This finding is particularly relevant
for speaking skill development, where anxiety represents a significant barrier to oral
communication practice.
A comprehensive systematic review by researchers has examined the effectiveness of
gamified tools across multiple language learning contexts. The findings revealed that the
effectiveness of gamified tools in foreign language learning was mixed, with some
bringing positive changes, others negative changes, and some showing no differences.
This variability underscores the importance of careful design and implementation
considerations rather than assuming that gamification is universally beneficial.
Recent research on serious game-based learning has shown significant impact on
happiness, motivation, self-compassion, and vocabulary development in EFL learners,
suggesting that the benefits of gamification extend beyond purely cognitive outcomes to
include important affective and social-emotional dimensions of learning.
The evidence base continues to expand with studies examining specific gamification
elements and their individual contributions to learning outcomes. Research has identified
several factors that appear to moderate gamification effectiveness, including learner age
and developmental level, prior gaming experience, cultural background, and the specific
language skills being targeted.
2.3 Speaking Skills Development in EFL
Speaking skills development in EFL contexts presents unique challenges that distinguish
it from other language skills acquisition. Oral communication requires the real-time
integration of multiple linguistic competencies including pronunciation, vocabulary,
grammar, and pragmatic awareness, while simultaneously managing the psychological
and social demands of interpersonal communication.
The complexity of speaking skill development is further compounded in EFL
environments where learners have limited opportunities for authentic communication
practice and may experience significant anxiety about making errors in front of others.
Traditional approaches to speaking instruction often emphasize accuracy over fluency,
leading to hesitant and overly cautious communication patterns that impede natural
language development.
Contemporary approaches to speaking instruction emphasize the importance of creating
psychologically safe environments that encourage risk-taking and experimentation with
language. This perspective aligns well with gamification principles, which can reduce the
stakes of making errors by framing mistakes as part of the learning process rather than
failures to be avoided.
2.3.1 Challenges in EFL Speaking Development
Foreign language anxiety represents one of the most significant obstacles to speaking
skill development, particularly among young learners who may lack confidence in their
linguistic abilities. Anxiety refers to "the subjective feeling of tensions, apprehensions,
nervousness, and worries related to an excitement of the autonomic nervous system," and
digital game-based learning can promote an active learning process while reducing this
anxiety among EFL learners.
Cultural factors also play a crucial role in speaking development, particularly in contexts
where educational traditions emphasize teacher authority and student deference. In many
Iranian classrooms, students may be reluctant to speak out or take communicative risks
due to cultural norms that discourage challenging authority or making public mistakes.
Limited authentic communication opportunities present another significant challenge, as
EFL learners often lack exposure to natural conversation partners and meaningful
communication contexts. This limitation is particularly pronounced in foreign language
contexts where English is not used for daily communication outside educational settings.
2.3.2 Gamification and Speaking Anxiety Reduction
Research has consistently demonstrated that gamification can effectively reduce speaking
anxiety through several mechanisms. Empirical studies have shown that gamification can
be effective in reducing anxiety among EFL learners through instructional interventions
that transform the learning experience. The game-like environment creates a sense of
play that can reduce the perceived seriousness of making errors, allowing learners to
experiment more freely with language.
The structured progression systems common in gamified platforms provide learners with
a sense of achievement and competence that can build confidence over time. As learners
accumulate points, unlock achievements, and advance through levels, they develop
increased self-efficacy beliefs about their speaking abilities.
Social features in gamified platforms can also support anxiety reduction by providing
structured interaction opportunities that feel less threatening than traditional classroom
speaking activities. Features such as voice chat with AI tutors or recorded speaking
challenges allow learners to practice without the immediate social pressure of
face-to-face communication.
2.4 Digital Game-Based Learning and Young Learners
Young learners present unique characteristics and needs that must be considered when
designing gamified learning experiences. Children's cognitive development, attention
spans, technological skills, and motivational patterns differ significantly from those of
adolescents and adults, requiring specialized approaches to educational game design.
Research on children's learning preferences suggests that effective educational games for
young learners should incorporate visual and auditory elements, provide frequent positive
feedback, maintain relatively simple interfaces, and include social interaction
opportunities. Studies examining digital versions of traditional games have shown that
primary school students can benefit from game-based approaches to vocabulary learning
and retention, particularly when games incorporate familiar elements that bridge
traditional play patterns with digital learning opportunities.
The developmental characteristics of primary school students also influence their
responses to different gamification elements. Young learners typically respond well to
immediate rewards and visual progress indicators, but may struggle with complex point
systems or long-term goal structures. Competition-based elements must be carefully
balanced to maintain motivation while avoiding discouragement among less confident
learners.
2.4.1 Cognitive and Motivational Considerations
Children's cognitive development during the primary school years includes significant
advances in abstract thinking, memory strategies, and metacognitive awareness.
However, young learners still benefit from concrete representations and hands-on
learning experiences, making the visual and interactive elements of gamified platforms
particularly suitable for this population.
Attention and engagement patterns among young learners require that educational games
provide varied activities, frequent transitions, and multiple sensory inputs to maintain
focus. The novelty and interactivity of digital games can be particularly effective in
capturing and maintaining children's attention compared to traditional instructional
methods.
Motivational patterns among young learners emphasize the importance of intrinsic
motivation, curiosity, and play-based learning. Gamification elements that support these
natural tendencies are more likely to be effective than those that rely primarily on
external rewards or competitive pressure.
2.4.2 Technology Integration in Primary Education
The integration of technology in primary education contexts requires careful
consideration of infrastructure, teacher training, and pedagogical alignment. Successful
implementation of gamified learning platforms depends on adequate technological
resources, reliable internet connectivity, and teacher competencies in digital pedagogy.
Research suggests that educators can employ human-AI interactive games to reduce
classroom anxiety and utilize intelligent learning companions to boost students' AI
learning self-efficacy and adaptive learning abilities, enabling learners to more effectively
express their viewpoints in a foreign language. This highlights the potential for
AI-enhanced gamified platforms to provide personalized learning experiences that adapt
to individual learner needs and preferences.
Professional development for teachers represents a crucial factor in successful technology
integration, as educators need both technical skills and pedagogical knowledge to
effectively implement gamified learning approaches. Training programs should address
not only the operational aspects of educational technologies but also the theoretical
principles underlying effective game-based learning design.
2.5 Iranian EFL Education Context
The Iranian educational system presents unique cultural, linguistic, and institutional
characteristics that influence the implementation and effectiveness of innovative
pedagogical approaches such as gamification. Understanding this context is essential for
designing and evaluating educational interventions that are culturally appropriate and
pedagogically effective.
Traditional approaches to English language teaching in Iranian schools have historically
emphasized grammar-translation methods, memorization of vocabulary lists, and
teacher-centered instruction. While recent educational reforms have called for more
communicative and student-centered approaches, implementation has been uneven, and
many classrooms continue to rely on traditional methods.
Cultural factors also play a significant role in shaping learning environments and student
expectations. Respect for teacher authority, emphasis on academic achievement, and
preference for structured learning activities are deeply embedded cultural values that
influence how students respond to different pedagogical approaches.
The integration of technology in Iranian primary education has accelerated in recent
years, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated rapid adoption
of digital learning tools. This experience has increased both teacher and student
familiarity with educational technologies, creating more favorable conditions for
implementing innovative approaches such as gamified learning platforms.
2.5.1 Challenges and Opportunities
Several challenges must be addressed when implementing gamified learning approaches
in Iranian primary EFL contexts. Infrastructure limitations, including inconsistent internet
connectivity and varying levels of access to digital devices, can impede effective
technology integration. Teacher preparation programs may not adequately address digital
pedagogy, leaving educators unprepared to effectively implement game-based learning
approaches.
However, significant opportunities also exist for enhancing EFL education through
gamification. High levels of student interest in digital technologies and games create
favorable conditions for engagement with gamified learning platforms. Growing
recognition among educators and policymakers of the need for innovative approaches to
language teaching provides institutional support for experimental pedagogical
approaches.
The cultural emphasis on education and achievement in Iranian society can be leveraged
through gamification elements that recognize student progress and provide clear
indicators of advancement. Achievement systems and progress tracking features align
well with cultural values that emphasize academic success and continuous improvement.
2.5.2 Recent Research in Iranian Contexts
Limited research has specifically examined gamification in Iranian EFL contexts,
representing a significant gap in the literature. The available studies have generally
focused on higher education contexts or adult learners, leaving primary school
applications largely unexplored.
This gap provides the rationale for the current study, which aims to contribute empirical
evidence regarding the effectiveness of gamified learning approaches for Iranian primary
school EFL learners. By examining outcomes specific to this population and context, the
research will provide valuable insights for educators, curriculum developers, and
policymakers interested in implementing innovative approaches to English language
education.
3. Methodology
3.1 Participants
The participants of this study will be Iranian primary school students enrolled in grades
4-6 (ages 9-12) in urban and suburban schools within Tehran province. A sample of
approximately 80 students will be recruited through convenience sampling from schools
that have agreed to participate in the research. The sample will be divided into two equal
groups of 40 students each: an experimental group that will use the gamified EFL
learning platform and a control group that will receive traditional speaking instruction.
All participants will be native Persian speakers with similar socioeconomic backgrounds
and prior English language learning experience. To ensure comparability between groups,
participants will be selected based on their current English proficiency level as
determined by standardized placement tests and teacher assessments. Students with
significant prior exposure to English-speaking environments or those receiving private
English tutoring will be excluded to maintain group homogeneity.
The selection criteria will include students who have completed at least one year of
formal English instruction, possess basic literacy skills in both Persian and English, and
have access to digital devices necessary for platform interaction. Parental consent and
student assent will be obtained for all participants before data collection begins.
3.2 Instrumentation
Multiple instruments will be used to assess speaking development and gather data on
student perceptions and learning outcomes.
3.2.1 Speaking Assessment Rubric
Speaking skills will be evaluated using a comprehensive rubric adapted from established
EFL assessment frameworks and validated for use with primary school learners. The
rubric assesses three primary dimensions: fluency (speech rate, hesitations, and natural
flow), pronunciation accuracy (phoneme production, word stress, and intonation
patterns), and speaking confidence (willingness to communicate, volume, and eye
contact). Each dimension is rated on a 5-point scale with detailed descriptors for each
level.
3.2.2 Pre- and Post-Test Speaking Tasks
Standardized speaking tasks will be administered before and after the intervention to
measure skill development. Tasks include picture description, role-play scenarios, and
structured interviews designed to elicit natural speech samples. All speaking sessions will
be audio-recorded for later analysis by trained raters to ensure reliability and validity of
assessments.
3.2.3 Student Perception Questionnaire
A questionnaire will be developed to assess students' perceptions of the gamified learning
experience, including enjoyment, perceived effectiveness, motivation levels, and
preferences for different learning activities. The questionnaire will use age-appropriate
language and visual scales suitable for primary school students.
3.2.4 Gamification Platform Analytics
The gamified learning platform will include built-in analytics to track student
engagement metrics such as time spent on activities, completion rates, points earned,
badges unlocked, and interaction patterns. These data will provide objective measures of
student engagement and platform usage.
3.3 Procedure
Following ethical approval from the university research committee and relevant
educational authorities, schools will be contacted to recruit participants and obtain
necessary permissions. Parents will receive detailed information about the study and
provide written consent for their children's participation.
The study will follow a quasi-experimental design with pre-test, intervention, and
post-test phases conducted over an 8-week period. During the first week, all participants
will complete pre-test speaking assessments and demographic questionnaires. The
experimental group will then receive training on using the gamified platform, while the
control group will continue with traditional speaking instruction methods.
The intervention phase will last six weeks, during which the experimental group will
engage with the gamified platform for 30 minutes per session, three times per week,
under teacher supervision. The platform will include speaking activities such as
pronunciation challenges, conversation simulations, vocabulary games, and interactive
storytelling tasks. Students will earn points for participation, badges for achieving
specific milestones, and advance through levels based on their performance.
The control group will receive equivalent amounts of speaking practice through
traditional methods including choral repetition, pair work, teacher-led dialogues, and
textbook-based activities. Both groups will be taught by the same teacher to control for
instructor variables.
During the final week, all participants will complete post-test speaking assessments using
the same instruments and procedures as the pre-test. Additionally, the experimental group
will complete the student perception questionnaire to gather data on their experiences
with the gamified platform.
3.4 Research Design
This study employs a quasi-experimental design with a non-equivalent control group to
examine the effectiveness of a gamified EFL learning platform on Iranian primary school
students' speaking development. The quasi-experimental approach is appropriate given
the practical constraints of educational research settings where random assignment of
students to groups may not be feasible due to existing classroom structures and
administrative considerations.
The design includes pre-test and post-test measurements to assess changes in speaking
skills over the intervention period, allowing for the examination of growth in both
experimental and control groups. The comparison between groups will provide evidence
regarding the differential effectiveness of gamified versus traditional instruction methods.
The six-week intervention period provides sufficient time for meaningful skill
development while remaining practical for implementation within existing school
schedules and curricula. This duration aligns with research recommendations for
educational interventions and allows for the observation of both immediate and
short-term retention effects.
3.5 Data Analysis
Data analysis will be conducted using SPSS software with multiple statistical procedures
to address the research questions comprehensively. Descriptive statistics will be
calculated for all variables to summarize participant characteristics and provide baseline
information about the sample.
To examine differences in speaking development between groups, independent samples
t-tests will be conducted comparing post-test scores between the experimental and control
groups, while controlling for pre-test performance through ANCOVA (Analysis of
Covariance). This approach will allow for the assessment of intervention effects while
accounting for initial differences between groups.
Paired samples t-tests will be used to examine within-group changes from pre-test to
post-test for both experimental and control groups, providing information about the
magnitude of improvement within each condition.
Effect sizes will be calculated using Cohen's d to determine the practical significance of
any observed differences between groups. This analysis will help interpret whether
statistically significant differences represent meaningful improvements in speaking skills.
For the qualitative data from student perception questionnaires, descriptive statistics and
frequency analyses will be conducted to summarize student responses and identify
patterns in their experiences with the gamified platform.
Platform analytics data will be analyzed using correlation analysis to examine
relationships between engagement metrics (time spent, activities completed, points
earned) and speaking skill improvements, providing insights into which platform features
are most associated with learning gains.
