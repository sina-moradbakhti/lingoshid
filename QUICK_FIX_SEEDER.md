# ✅ Seeder Fixed - ts-node Issue Resolved

## What Was Wrong

The deploy script was using `npm run seed` which requires `ts-node` (TypeScript runtime). This is not available in production Docker containers.

## What I Fixed

Changed to use `npm run seed:prod` which runs the compiled JavaScript version.

### Files Updated:

1. **deploy.sh** - Line 154 & 220
   - Changed `npm run seed` → `npm run seed:prod`

2. **server/SEEDER_README.md** - Updated documentation

3. **SEEDER_UPGRADE.md** - Updated commands

## ✅ How to Use Now

### On Your Server (Production):

```bash
# Option 1: Use deploy script (RECOMMENDED)
cd ~/lingoshid
./deploy.sh
# Select option 6

# Option 2: Direct command
cd ~/lingoshid
docker compose exec backend npm run seed:prod
```

### Local Development:

```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

## 🎯 Test It Now!

Try it on your server:

```bash
cd ~/lingoshid
./deploy.sh
```

Select **6**, confirm with **y**, and watch the magic happen! 🎉

You should see:
